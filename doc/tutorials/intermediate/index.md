## Intermediate Tutorials

These tutorials are for you that is ready to navigate and explore more advanced features of Python and Panel.

We will build more performant, scalable, polished, reusable and maintainable versions of the applications from the basic tutorial.

After these tutorials you will be able to build a wide range of large and complex multi-page apps structured across multiple files using a *class based approach*.

I will assume you have a *basic skill level* corresponding to the what you get from the [Basic Tutorials](../basic/index.md).
