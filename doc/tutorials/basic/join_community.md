## Detailed discussions on Discourse

:::{admonition} Note
[Discourse](https://discourse.holoviz.org/) is the place for detailed discussions around code. Here you can ask for help, find answers to other users questions and show case your work.

When asking questions please include a [Minimal, Reproducible Example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) if at all possible. It will make it much, much easier to help you.
