## Basic Tutorials

These tutorials are for you that is just starting to discover Panel.

Together we will explore the wind turbine data and build a chat bot, a static report, a todo app, an image classier app, a dashboard and a streaming application together.

After these tutorials you will be able to build a wide range of polished, single page apps from a single file using a *function based approach*.

## Prerequisites

I will assume you have successfully been able to [install Panel](../../getting_started/installation.md) as described in the [Getting Started Guide](../../getting_started/index.md). If not please reach out for help on [Discord](https://discord.gg/rb6gPXbdAr).
