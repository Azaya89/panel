# Basic Tutorials

Welcome to our Basic Tutorials, tailored for those who are eager to start their journey into Panel systematically. If you're still undecided, we highly recommend starting with the [Getting Started Guide](../../getting_started/index.md) first.

Get ready to embark on an exciting exploration of wind turbine data! We'll equip you with the skills to build a diverse range of applications, including a chatbot, a static report, a todo app, an image classifier app, a dashboard, and even a streaming application. Consider yourself on the path from zero to hero in no time!

Before we dive in, ensure you've successfully [installed Panel](../../getting_started/installation.md) as outlined in the [Getting Started Guide](../../getting_started/index.md). If you encounter any hurdles along the way, don't hesitate to seek assistance on [Discord](https://discord.gg/rb6gPXbdAr).

But first, safety first! Don't forget to put on your metaphorical safety helmet before immersing yourself in the world of wind turbine data apps.

### Part 2. Display Content

Learn to showcase content effectively:

- **[Display Content with `pn.panel`](pn_panel.md):** Easily present wind turbine images, data, and plots using `pn.panel`.
- **[Display Content with Panes](panes.md):** Fine-tune how wind turbine data is displayed with Panes for tailored visualization.
- **[Display Performance with Indicators](indicators_performance.md):** Showcase performance metrics of your wind turbines using Panel's Indicators.

### Part 3. Organize Content

Master the art of organizing content:

- **[Layout Content](layouts.md):** Efficiently arrange Panel apps for both beauty and functionality.
- **[Control the Size](size.md):** Explore sizing options in Panel, ensuring responsiveness and adaptability.
- **[Align Content](align.md):** Perfectly align wind turbine images using alignment tools and spacers.

### Part 4. Handle User Input

Enhance interactivity by handling user input:

- **[Accept Inputs with Widgets](widgets.md):** Elevate app functionality by incorporating user inputs via widgets.
- **[React to User Input](pn_bind.md):** Foster user engagement by responding dynamically to user interactions.
- **[Handle State](state.md):** Manage state effectively to build larger and more complex apps.

### Part 5. Improve the Look

Enhance visual appeal:

- **[Use Templates](templates.md):** Employ pre-made templates for streamlined app layout.
- **[Apply A Design](design.md):** Customize app design to suit your style and functionality.
- **[Use Styles](style.md):** Fine-tune component styling for aesthetic and user-friendly apps.

### Part 6. Improve the Feel

Optimize performance and user experience:

- **[Add Caching](caching.md):** Optimize app performance with caching for smoother operation.
- **[Display Activity](indicators_activity.md):** Show app activity with indicators and notifications for enhanced user feedback.
- **[Update Progressively](progressive_layouts.md):** Leverage generators and reactive expressions for dynamic app updates.

### Part 7. Share as a Hero

Share your creations with the world:

- **[Build a Dashboard](build_dashboard.md):** Construct a comprehensive dashboard for insightful data presentation.
- **[Deploy a Dashboard](deploy.md):** Share your dashboard with users by deploying it to Hugging Face spaces.
