# Basic Tutorials

These tutorials are for those who are just starting to discover Panel.

Together, we will explore the wind turbine data and build a chat bot, a static report, a todo app, an image classifier app, a dashboard, and a streaming application.

After completing these tutorials, we will be able to build a wide range of polished, single page apps from a single file using a *function-based approach*.

## Prerequisites

We assume you have successfully been able to [install Panel](../../getting_started/installation.md) as described in the [Getting Started Guide](../../getting_started/index.md). If not, please reach out for help on [Discord](https://discord.gg/rb6gPXbdAr).
