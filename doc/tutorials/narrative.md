# Tutorials

:::{note}
To make our tutorials engaging and purposeful we will be exploring data and developing data apps in the domain of wind turbines. Your instructor will be very, very passionate about wind turbines. We hope you will have a laugh and play along.

We believe the skills you will be getting are easily transferable to any domain including yours.

Imagine standing amidst a vast field of towering wind turbines, harnessing the invisible force of wind to generate clean, renewable energy. In this series of tutorials, we'll embark on a journey to understand, analyze, and visualize the world of wind turbine data using Panel by HoloViz.

Whether you're a newcomer or an experienced developer, our goal is to take you from a novice to a (wind turbine) data app hero.

Together we will explore the world of wind turbine data and build

- a Hello Wind Turbine World app
- a Wind Turbine Chat Bot
- a static Wind Turbine Analysis report
- a Wind Turbine Technician todo app
- a Wind Turbine Dashboard
- A Wind Turbine Image Recognition app
- a Wind Turbine Live Data Monitoring application.

Please put on your safety helmet before entering the world of wind turbine data apps.

## Basic App Developer

:::{note}
To keep things basic we will be building apps in a single file using *Widgets* and `pn.bind`. In the *Intermediate App Developer* tutorials we will explore more advanced techniques and build larger multi-file and multi-page apps.

## Prerequisites

I will assume you have successfully been able to [install Panel](../getting_started/installation.md) as described in the [Getting Started Guide](../getting_started/index.md). If not please reach out for help on [Discord](https://discord.gg/rb6gPXbdAr).

### Part 1: Get Started

#### Build an App

Kickstart your journey by creating a "Hello Wind Turbine World" app from a Python script, Notebook, or Markdown document.

#### Build a Chat Bot

Develop a streaming Wind Turbine Chat Bot that can handle many wind turbine enthuasists bombarding it with their questions about wind turbines.

### Part 2: Develop Efficiently

#### Develop in a Notebook

Discover tips and tricks that will make you *swift as the wind* at exploring turbine data and building wind turbine data apps in a notebook.

#### Develop in an Editor

Discover tips and tricks that will increase your *developer capacity* from kilo watts to mega watts when you develop in an editor!

### Part 3: Display Content

#### Display Content with `pn.panel`

Display your beloved wind turbines images, data and plots easily and dynamically with `pn.panel`.

#### Display Content with Panes

Control how your wind turbine data are displayed with Panes, ensuring your data apps can meet the unique demands of wind turbine data visualization.

### Part 4: Organize Components

#### Use Templates

Use pre-made templates to easily layout your apps with a header, sidebar and main area.

#### Layout Content

Layout your Panel apps as beautifully as you would layout your wind farm. Understand inherent sizing, fixed sizing and responsive layouts.

#### Build a Static Report

Apply your skills to construct a static Wind Turbine Report, exportable to HTML for efficient distribution to management.

### Part 4: Handle User Input

#### Accept User Input

Elevate your app's functionality by accepting user input via widgets. Add nice tooltips with explanations to your users or disable them for security reasons.

#### React to User Input

React to user input by leveraging `pn.bind`, enabling your users to foster a deeper understanding of wind turbine data through exploration.

#### Handle State

Build larger and more complex apps by defining state via `pn.rx`.

#### Build a Todo App

Enable your wind turbine technicians to keep track of their tasks.

### Part 5: Show Activity

### Indicators

Indicate activity

#### Update your layouts progressively

Unleash the power of generators in your Wind Turbine Apps!

#### Build an Image Recognition App

Build an image recognition app to identify cracks in your wind turbine blades.

### Part 7: Improve Performance

#### Add Caching

### Part 8: Advanced Layout and Styling

#### Finetune your layouts

#### Style Your Apps

Explore various approaches to styling Panel components, from applying design components to customizing with stylesheets and CSS classes. Ensure your wind turbine data apps are both aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly.

#### Build a Polished Dashboard

We'll guide you through advanced styling, layout optimization, and data visualization techniques to build a refined Wind Turbine Dashboard

### Part 9: Deployment your app

#### Deploy your app

Get your dashboard in the hands of your users. Lets deploy it to Hugging Face spaces

## Intermediate App Developer
