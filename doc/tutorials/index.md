# Tutorials

:::{admonition} Note
To make our tutorials engaging and purposeful we will be exploring data and developing data apps in the domain of wind turbines. Your instructor will be very, very passionate about wind turbines. We hope you will have a laugh and play along.

We believe the skills you will be getting are easily transferable to any domain including yours.
:::

Imagine standing amidst a vast field of towering wind turbines, harnessing the invisible force of wind to generate clean, renewable energy. In this series of tutorials, we'll embark on a journey to understand, analyze, and visualize the world of wind turbine data using Panel by HoloViz.

Whether you're a newcomer or an experienced developer, our goal is to take you from a novice to a (wind turbine) data app hero.

Together we will explore the world of wind turbine data and build

- a Hello Wind Turbine World app
- a Wind Turbine Chat Bot
- a static Wind Turbine Analysis report
- a Wind Turbine Technician todo app
- a Wind Turbine Dashboard
- A Wind Turbine Image Recognition app
- a Wind Turbine Live Data Monitoring application.

Please put on your safety helmet before entering the world of wind turbine data apps.
